# Calculator

A simple **console-based calculator** written in C. This project demonstrates how to build a small C application using CMake, and how to generate both a native Linux executable (`calculator`) and a Windows-style executable (`calculator.exe`) along with a helper shell script (`run_calculator.sh`)


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`) (with division-by-zero check)
  - Interactive CLI interface
